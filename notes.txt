I found that playing with the "rate" at which the preferences update causes different 
convergence behavior. For example, with the stag and hare game, when the rate was at 
.01 and the sims were at 1000, I got both [0, 1] and [1, 0] convergence pretty consistently. 
However, when the "rate" was at .005 and the sims were are 3000, I kept getting [1, 0]. 
Unfortunately, at .01, the strats converge really fast, which is kinda boring.
